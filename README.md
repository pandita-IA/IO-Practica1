# Practice 1: Operations Research

This repository contains implementations and tools for exploring various methods and techniques in operations research, machine learning, and adversarial attacks.

## Features

### 1. **Simplex Method**  
   - Implements the **Simplex Method** for solving linear programming problems:
     - **Primal** formulation
     - **Dual** formulation
     - **Complete** method for comprehensive problem solving

### 2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Creation**  
   - Builds an SVM using the **Simplex Method**, demonstrating the integration of optimization techniques in machine learning.

### 3. **Adversarial Attacks on Neural Networks**  
   - Includes **Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)** for generating adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of neural networks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
